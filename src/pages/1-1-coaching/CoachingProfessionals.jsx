                It’s 4:45 p.m. on a Tuesday.  You take another look at the spreadsheet you’ve been working on for the past two hours and then one more glance at the clock; 4:46 p.m.  Only 14 more minutes left until it’s 5 o’clock and you can finally log off and shut down the computer for the night so you can spend a little bit of time with your loved ones.
            </p>
            <p>
                Does this sound a little too similar to a Tuesday that you’ve had maybe a hundred times after years at the office?

                Millions of people in the workforce are currently unhappy with their jobs, yet they don’t do anything to take control of their situations.  They accept where they are as something they have to do, and hope that one day, sometime in the future, it will get better.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Do you feel a sense of purpose in your current role?  Does your work feel meaningful?  If you’ve answered “no” to either of these questions it may be time to re-evaluate your current career path.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may be thinking to yourself, “I’m stuck where I am and have no idea where to start.”  Well, the good news is you’ve come to the right place.  Feelings of fear, anxiety, stress, and hopelessness are common for professionals who’ve been in their roles for longer than they had planned.  We understand those feelings and have the tools to support you in changing those feelings into ones of happiness and relief when you find yourself doing something you’ve always wanted to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maybe you’ve watched your family and friends find careers that are perfectly suited for them and you’re wondering why you’ve been in the same place for the last 10 years with no room to grow and no interest in wanting to grow.  No matter what the reasons are for where your journey has taken you and regardless of how long you are into your career, it’s never to late to make a change.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether you’re a 35-year-old parent looking to improve your work-life balance because you want to spend as much time as you can with your young children, or a 60-year-old looking to finish your career doing something you love in a different industry after spending 40 years working to pay the bills, Your Career Strategy can guide you along the path that’s right for you.

            <p>
                One of the most important aspects of our career coaching strategy is focusing on helping you to evaluate yourself from the inside out.  Far too often, this step, which is arguably the most important, is skipped during the process of trying to change careers.  We guide you in taking a step back and looking at what’s inside of you.

We also understand that making a career transition has a lot of moving parts including salary needs and cost of living standards just to name a few.  We want to make sure you make the right choice and find an industry that satisfies all your needs.
