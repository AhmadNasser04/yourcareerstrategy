                You’ve spent years dreaming of opening your own pizzeria.  You spent your nights and weekends learning how to perfect the perfect pizza pie.  You even took some trainings on how to run your own business and saved up enough money to finally make it happen.
            </p>
            <p>
                You quit your job, opened your business and there’s a line of new customers eager to try your food.  Making the perfect pizza comes easy to you, but you are beginning to become overwhelmed at how hard it is to run a business.  The hiring, becoming a people manager for the first time, the scheduling, the finances.  It’s all become a whirlwind that you need to get control of before you wind up like millions of new restaurants that close within the first few years of opening.

                Leadership and performance coaching isn’t solely for entrepreneurs, we love working with new managers and directors who are stepping into a big role for the first time and coming face to face with feelings of imposter syndrome and start questioning their capacity for delivering on the expectations of the role.  How do you effectively manage teams and balance business objectives without losing your authenticity?  How can you control your calendar so it doesn’t end up controlling you?  What can you do to create a psychologically safe environment for your teams and learn to manage up effectively to maintain a culture that you can feel proud to be a part of?
