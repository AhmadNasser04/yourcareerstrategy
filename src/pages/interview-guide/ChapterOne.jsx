        <p className='font-semibold'>To interview is to share your life story in relevant bite-sized pieces. We'd like to ease your concerns by highlighting a few common misconceptions around interviewing.</p>
        <ol className='space-y-5 list-disc pl-5'>
            <li>The interviewer doesn't care that you are nervous and doesn't have a preconceived notion about what your answers should be. It's your life, tell your story in your own words.</li>
            <li>​98% of interviewees are worried about what they think the company wants to hear vs. the 2% who differentiate themselves with authenticity: showing the interviewer how they think. Stand out and show the company who you really are. The ones interviewing you are assessing their future colleague, the person they will be spending 1/3 of their life with for the foreseeable future, not some scripted work-bot.</li>
            <li>​You are dealing with human beings during both the application process and the interview. These people have families, dreams, emotions, and a complex life just like you. Go into the interview with an openness to human connection and approach the situation as a conversation rather than a one-sided interrogation.</li>
